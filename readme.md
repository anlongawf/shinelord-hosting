# Setup Guide

## Required Files
Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
- `name.file.key`
- `name.file.perm`

Create a folder named `ssl/` and place these files inside it.

## Environment Configuration
You need to set up the `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
PANEL_URL=your_panel_url_here
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_panel_url_here` with the actual Panel URL and `your_api_key_here` with your API key.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly formatted and saved in the root directory of your project.
- Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

You're now ready to proceed with your setup!
